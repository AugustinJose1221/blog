          <p align="justify">Guess a number from zero to nine… Done. Is it seven.. Most probably it might be right. In fact tests
                             prove that almost 79% of the people tested guessed seven. But why. Naturally we neglect even numbers
                             just because they’re even. We also neglect composite numbers because they are multiples of prime numbers.
                             That leave 1,3,5,7. One being unity and five being half of ten, we usually get stuck with 3 and 7. Yet
                             people discard three. Why Three? Is it because of some conspiracy theory taken for granted? What makes
                             this character stand apart from the rest?<br><br>

                             History of three leads back to the Romans who denoted it as III. It was the Indians and the Arabs who
                             designed this modern day glyph. It also is the number of ancient civilizations namely Mesopotamian,
                             Indus Valley and Chinese.Myths and legends have a great significance too. So does religion.<br><br>

                             The Thrimurthi in Hinduism,Holy Trinity in Christian belief,Three sons of Kronos- Zeus, Poseidon, Hades.
                             Christianity has far greater link to this number. Jesus rise from the dead on the third day. St. Peter
                             denied Christ three times. The Devil tempted Christ thrice. Jonah lived inside a fish three days and three
                             nights. The Magi brought three gifts to Baby Jesus. Heaven,Hell and Purgatory making the three final
                             resting place after the Judgement day.<br><br>

                             Science and Mathematics has lots of mysteries concerning the number three. The number of dimensions
                             perceivable by humans is three. Newton’s laws of motion,Kepler’s laws ,all stops at third law. Fundamental
                             colours are three in number. In Alchemy, there are three primes-salt,mercury and sulphur.<br><br>

                             Mathematics has the greatest connection of them all. It is the integer between e and π-two fundamentals
                             of mathematics. It is the first odd prime number. It is also the average of e, π and twice the Golden ratio.<br><br>

                             The number of coordinate axes is three. Three is the first Mersenne prime and Fermat prime. The smallest
                             number of sides a polygon can have is three. Three is the only number which is the sum of all numbers below it.<br><br>

                             But what makes three stand apart in our mind is it’s influence in day-to-day life. Three is considered as a
                             lucky number and hence the saying “ Third time’s the charm”. We also often use the phrase “on the count of
                             three”. We describes the third successful attempt as a ‘hatrick’. We usually ends a sentence or a text with
                             three dots(…). We type random letters in threes like kkk and Mmm. Three Musketeers,Three Mistakes of my life,
                             Three Bridesmaids and many other books with titles signifying three. Besides the titles, many stories are
                             centered around three something. Three kingdom of men in Lord of the Rings, the three friends in Harry Potter
                             and three students in Three Idiots. There are three fundamental characters in a story- a hero, a heroine and
                             a villain.<br><br>

                             Number three has a lot of usage in sports too.<br><br>

                             Almost all races starts with ‘One, Two, Three , Go’. Cricket uses three stumps and have three formats. Thirdman
                             is a fielder’s position in cricket. Final decisions is made by the Third Umpire. In football maximum number
                             of substitutions is three. We often use the line “Three strikes in row” too. Link between three and sports
                             can’t get any closer than Triathalon and Triple Jump.<br><br>

                             Often in literature, threes appear in the weirdest of place. Basically, literature is divided into three-poetry,
                             drama and prose.<br><br>

                             Major writers always use three character technique to include humor or twists in the plot.Rhymes are generally
                             represented by the letters like ABA or ABC. Usually experts prefer to acknowledge three great personalities.
                             The big three in English- Shakesphere, Milton and Chaucer. As for Malayalam literature there are three
                             Purathanakavithrayam and three Athunikakavithrayam.<br><br>

                             The musical community also shares a close relation with the number three. Musical instruments are divided into
                             three- percussion, string and wind. Music community also recognize Beethoven, Mozart and Bach as the three
                             greatest composers. A trio is a musical technique of mixing the different sounds to produce a better output.<br><br>

                             Are our simple decisions like guessing a number influenced by a million facts. Or all these facts where linked
                             to this number due to psychological connection humans share with this number. Are our brains wired to add a three
                             into anything and everything. Time will tell and perhaps a time will come when three becomes something more than
                             a scribble in a kid’s notebook. But we are limited to the three dimensions and may be the key to a time machine
                             be three, who knows…</p>
