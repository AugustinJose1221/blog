          <p align="justify"> The search for prime numbers has been going on for quite a while, both man and machine spending time and effort to
						 									add a new one to the ever growing list of these curious numbers.Every new prime number discovered holds the title
															for the largest prime number known to man.It took almost three months to prove the primality of the largest prime
															till date.If you think three months is a lot of time, just remember,it’s been two thousand years its inception and
															people still don’t know anything about the primality of unity.<br><br>

															Every renowned mathematician in history has tried to tackle these bizarre numbers.Euclid was the first to prove the
															infiniteness of prime numbers.Euler stole the show with his enormous contribution to the understanding of prime.You
															wouldn’t have a prime named after you for something so simple.And Euler has a set of them called Euler’s lucky numbers.
															Bernhard Riemann pulled a trick no one in the mathematical world has ever seen.He devised an equation to predict the
															occurrence of prime numbers.It is said that he kept the proof to himself and it was never published.He would have been
															a million dollars richer if he was alive today.Well if anyone wants to be a million dollars richer, pick up a pen and
															paper and solve Riemann hypothesis and the Clay Mathematical Institute would take care of the financial part.<br><br>

															So why do these numbers have such attention? Simply because we know little about it.Take pi for example.Almost all
															place it makes an entrance has been figured out.Even the billionth decimal place has been found out.The more we know
															about it, the less attention we give.People don’t care about the irrationality of pi anymore.The probable question is
															why then care about the infiniteness of primes.<br><br>

															When it comes to primes, the more number of them we know, the better.Primes play a vital role in the security
															infrastructure of any digital communication.The difficulty in finding primes and factorizing numbers into primes is the
															basis of RSA encryption.Better encryption is guaranteed by extending database of prime numbers.There was a time when
															prime numbers were regarded useless in the physical world.It was almost 90 years ago and a century later we stand in a
															world secured by prime numbers.<br><br>

															So that is the reason why people are so relentless to find a new prime number.A prize of 1000 dollars is also a
															motivation boost.It should be easier compared to a million dollar question.If you’re up for the challenge, here’s a head
															up. Consider the numbers to the north of 2⁸²⁵⁸⁹⁹³³.</p>
